# Abstract {-}

The engineering design process has a significant computational component involving analysis of multiple load cases and parameter studies, with the aim of identifying a combination of design parameters that yields an optimal design solution. Traditionally engineering design methodolgies have been very manual and iterative, however recent developments in computer technologies are driving a growing trend towards automation. This article presents [Pflacs]{.smallcaps} an open-source Python package that takes advantage of Python's flexible dynamic nature and its introspection tools to provide an object-orientated framework for automating computational studies.

[Pflacs]{.smallcaps} binds data and Python functions together in an object-orientated fashion, and uses a tree data structure that is reflective of the hierarchical structure of many design projects. The author has a background in the subsea oil & gas industry, and has applied  [Pflacs]{.smallcaps} to automating the  design of subsea pipelines.  Although its origins are in engineering design, [Pflacs]{.smallcaps} can be used to manage and automate parameter study type analysis in any domain.
