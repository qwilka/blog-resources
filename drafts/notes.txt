The engineering design process (simplified)
...........................................

Typically, an engineering project will start by gathering relevant information
and producing a *design basis* document, in the case where the client
has a strong workscope specification,
or a *design premise* document, in the case where determination of the input
data specification is left to the engineering contractor.

The Short Summary
==================
Engineering design typically 
has a significant computational component
involving large numbers of input parameters and
multiple load cases.
Traditionally the engineering design process has been
very manual and iterative, however  
recent technological developments are driving
a growing trend towards automation.
This article presents ``pflacs``, an open-source Python package that takes
advantage of Python's flexible dynamic nature and its introspection tools
to provide an object-orientated environment for 
managing and automating computational studies.
``pflacs`` has been developed to expedite the design of
subsea pipelines, but it could be employed to manage
computational projects or parameter studies in any domain.

abstract
========
The engineering design process has a significant computational component
involving analysis of
multiple load cases and parameter studies, with the aim of identifying 
a combination of design parameters that yields an optimal design solution.
Traditional civil and mechanical engineering design methodolgies have 
tended to be very manual and iterative, however  
recent developments in computer technologies are driving
a growing trend towards automation.
The proposed talk presents ``pflacs``, an open-source Python package that takes
advantage of Python's flexible dynamic nature and its introspection tools
to provide an object-orientated framework for automating computational studies.
``pflacs`` binds data and Python functions together in an object-orientated
fashion, and uses a tree data structure that is reflective of the hierarchical 
structure of many design projects. The author has a background in the subsea
oil & gas industry, and has applied  ``pflacs`` to automating the  design
of subsea pipelines.  Although its origins are in engineering design, ``pflacs`` 
can be used to manage and automate parameter study type analysis in
any domain.

``pflacs`` binds data and Python functions together in an object-orientated
fashion, and uses a tree data structure that is reflective of the hierarchical 
structure of many design projects.


``pflacs`` is a pure Python module that facilitates parameter studies. 
``pflacs`` is a simple Python tree :cite:`vntree`.
``pflacs`` provides a means of integrating input data with pure Python functions.
``pflacs`` is a tree data structure that operates in a hierarchical workflow that is
reflective of typical engineering project structure.
What differentiates pflacs is the way it uses Python dynamic programming and introspection.
