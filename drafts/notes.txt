The engineering design process (simplified)
...........................................

Typically, an engineering project will start by gathering relevant information
and producing a *design basis* document, in the case where the client
has a strong workscope specification,
or a *design premise* document, in the case where determination of the input
data specification is left to the engineering contractor.
