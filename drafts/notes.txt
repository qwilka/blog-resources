The engineering design process (simplified)
...........................................

Typically, an engineering project will start by gathering relevant information
and producing a *design basis* document, in the case where the client
has a strong workscope specification,
or a *design premise* document, in the case where determination of the input
data specification is left to the engineering contractor.

The Short Summary
==================
Engineering design typically 
has a significant computational component
involving large numbers of input parameters and
multiple load cases.
Traditionally the engineering design process has been
very manual and iterative, however  
recent technological developments are driving
a growing trend towards automation.
This article presents ``pflacs``, an open-source Python package that takes
advantage of Python's flexible dynamic nature and its introspection tools
to provide an object-orientated framework for 
managing and automating computational studies.
``pflacs`` has been developed to expedite the design of
subsea pipelines, but it could be employed to manage
computational projects or parameter studies in any domain.



``pflacs`` binds data and Python functions together in an object-orientated
fashion, and uses a tree data structure that is reflective of the hierarchical 
structure of many design projects.
